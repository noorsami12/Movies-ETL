# Movies-ETL
## The purpose of this project is to extract, transform, and load large amounts of movie data from various sources, such as Wikipedia and Kaggle. Data was cleaned up using regular expressions and detailed comparison of rows and columns, as well as creating uniformity among data combined from different sources. Wikpedia data, Kaggle data, and MovieLens data was merged to create a comprehensive table of movies. Finally, the movie and ratings tables exported to SQL.
